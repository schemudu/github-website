My name is Saurav (Suh - Row / Sir - Oh), and welcome to my personal treasure trove of achievements and ambitions. \r\n\r\n# Some history\r\n- I was born in Covina, CA which is about 20 miles away from downtown Los Angeles. However, my only memories of this place start when I came back in 2017. Until I was about 6 we moved around a lot in the east coast until we ultimatley ended up in Ashburn, VA. Funny story we actually found our current house by taking a wrong turn when trying to find the local mall, I'm very happy that Google Maps wasn't around back then.\r\n\r\n- At 7, My parents got me a red Game Boy Advance SP with Donkey Kong Country, Pokemon Emerald, Cartoon Network Block Party, and Sonic Advance 2. Sadly I ended up leaving it my pocket and my first real piece of tech got waterlogged in the washing machine. (I got another one in grey that I still have :D)\r\n\r\n- At 8, A family friend had gifted me an original Xbox with Burnout 3: Takedown, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, and the original Spiderman. I was also given a Nintendo DS, but I don't have any recollection of actually using it for anything other than piktochat. \r\n\r\n- At 9, I got my first phone, Sony Ericsson W350i, no one really had a phone in 3rd grade so I don't think I ever called anyone but my parents. I did however assume it was waterproof and proceeded to hose it down to show it off to my friends... the battery doubled in size and flew out the back panel. Seems to be a a reoccuring theme.\r\n\r\n- At 10, I made my first email account which I marketed to the entirety of my 5th grade class on the last day of school. I still actively use this account and have half of my elementary class as favorited contacts.\r\n\r\n- At 11, I picked up my very first instrument, the trumpet, and realized I have no musical talent what so ever. I continued to pursue music, moreover the guitar for the next 3 years where I finally accepted the fact that I can't read or comphrend music. I now rock a ukulele and know 4 of my favorite songs ... (They only use 4 chords)\r\n\r\n- At 12, This was one of the most memorable years of my life. I went on my first cruise, travelled to india, bought my favorite video game (Minecraft), and won my first tennis tournament.\r\n\r\n- At 13, I starting learning how to type without looking at the keyboard, but I managed to get the lowest grade I have ever gotten in school. I now can max out my typing speeds at 110+ when I'm really in the groove.\r\n\r\n- During my freshman year of highschool I got my very first laptop, HP Pavillion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# I like\r\n\r\n- Hiking\r\n\r\n- Snowboarding\r\n\r\n- Welding / Woodwork\r\n\r\n- Video Games\r\n\r\n- Food / Cooking\r\n\r\n",d=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(o.jsx)(r.b,Object(a.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(o.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Saurav Chemudu",children:Object(o.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(o.jsx)("header",{children:Object(o.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(o.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(o.jsx)(r.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(o.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(o.jsx)(s.a,{source:h,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
